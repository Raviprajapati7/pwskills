    "Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.\n",
    "Answer 1:An exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, which disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exceptional situation arises, Python raises an exception, which can then be caught and handled using exception handling mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference between Exceptions and Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cause: Syntax errors occur when the Python interpreter detects a violation of the language syntax rules. They are typically caused by misspelled keywords, missing colons, parentheses mismatch, or incorrect indentation. Syntax errors prevent the code from being compiled or interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "   On the other hand, exceptions occur during the execution of a program when an error or unexpected condition arises, such as division by zero, accessing an out-of-range index, or attempting to open a non-existent file. Exceptions can be caused by a variety of factors, including incorrect input, external dependencies, or logical errors in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Time of occurrence: Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing and compilation phase, before the program is executed. This means that the program will not run until the syntax errors are fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Exceptions, on the other hand, occur during the runtime of the program. They can arise from conditions that were not anticipated or handled explicitly in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Handling: Syntax errors need to be fixed by modifying the code to adhere to the correct syntax rules. The Python interpreter provides specific error messages that help identify the source of the syntax error, allowing developers to correct it.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Exceptions, however, can be handled using exception handling mechanisms such as try-except blocks. By wrapping potentially error-prone code in a try block and providing one or more except blocks, developers can catch and handle exceptions gracefully, allowing the program to continue execution or perform alternative actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, syntax errors are related to violations of the language syntax rules and occur during the parsing and compilation phase, while exceptions occur during program execution when unexpected or error conditions arise and can be caught and handled using exception handling mechanisms."

    "Answer 2:When an exception is not handled, it results in the termination of the program and an error message is displayed to the user. This is known as an \"unhandled exception\" or an \"uncaught exception.\" The error message typically provides information about the type of exception that occurred, along with a traceback that shows the sequence of function calls and line numbers where the exception was raised.\n",
